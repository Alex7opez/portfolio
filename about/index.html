                        <p>My personal work is visible on the "portfolio" tab. Outside of my personal work, I was a music producer for 2 1/2 years, where I created a network of producers and artists and helped connect people who were growing in the underground music scene. I no longer produce but I still keep in contact with some of my old friends.</p>

                        <p>In the past year I've gotten into skateboarding. I owned a pre-built board for a couple of years but when I built my own last year it gained more of my interest. Now I am applying my film knowledge to recording skate movies. I also like to make clothes, I have designed hats, shirts and other items with spray paint and cut and sew additions.</p>
